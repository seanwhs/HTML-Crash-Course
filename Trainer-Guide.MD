* Encourage learners to use local or online media files.

**Activity:** Learners add an image and/or video to their “About Me” page.

---

### **4. Tables (30 min)**

**Objective:** Present structured data using tables.
**Trainer Notes:**

* Show table structure: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`.
* Emphasize readability and proper indentation.

**Activity:** Learners create a table for a schedule, grades, or sample data.

---

### **5. Forms (1 hour)**

**Objective:** Collect user input through HTML forms.
**Trainer Notes:**

* Explain `<form>` and input types: `text`, `email`, `password`, `submit`.
* Show `<label>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`/`<option>`, and checkboxes/radio buttons.
* Demonstrate basic validation attributes like `required`.

**Activity:** Learners create a contact form with name, email, message, and submit button.

---

### **6. Semantic HTML & Best Practices (30 min)**

**Objective:** Introduce semantic tags and accessibility.
**Trainer Notes:**

* Demonstrate `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`.
* Emphasize semantic structure, SEO, and accessibility (alt text, labels).

**Activity:** Learners restructure their page using semantic tags.

---

### **7. Final Hands-On Project (1–1.5 hours)**

**Objective:** Build a fully structured mini-website using all learned concepts.
**Trainer Notes:**

* Encourage learners to combine:

  * Headings, paragraphs, lists
  * Links, images, tables
  * Forms
  * Semantic layout (header, nav, main, footer)
* Walk around to provide guidance and answer questions.

---

### **8. Wrap-Up & Resources (15–30 min)**

* Review key concepts learned.
* Share resources:

  * [MDN Web Docs – HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
  * [W3Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
  * Practice on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)
* Encourage learners to practice daily and explore CSS next.

---

## **Trainer Tips**

* **Keep sessions interactive:** Alternate between demonstration and hands-on exercises.
* **Use live coding:** Typing examples in real-time helps learners understand syntax.
* **Encourage experimentation:** Let learners modify tags and attributes to see effects.
* **Provide small challenges:** E.g., “Add a new list item” or “Create a second table row”.
* **Monitor progress:** Walk around and assist learners individually.
