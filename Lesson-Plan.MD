## **Materials Needed**

* Computer/laptop with code editor installed (VS Code recommended)
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
* Projector for demonstrations
* Example images, audio, or video files for exercises
* Optional: Printed learner guide/workbook

---

## **Teaching Tips**

1. Alternate **lecture and hands-on practice** to keep learners engaged.
2. Encourage experimentation with tags and attributes.
3. Use **live coding** to demonstrate errors and corrections.
4. Provide **small challenges** after each topic to reinforce learning.
5. Walk around and **assist learners individually** during exercises.

## **Assessment / Checkpoints**

* Observe learners during hands-on exercises
* Ask learners to explain their code after each section
* Final project serves as a summative assessment
